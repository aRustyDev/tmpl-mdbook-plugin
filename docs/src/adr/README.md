# Architecture Decision Records

This section documents key architectural decisions made during development.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They provide a historical record of why certain decisions were made.

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [001](./001-design.md) | Initial Design | Proposed |

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions, create a new ADR using this template:

```markdown
# ADR XXX: Title

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Context

[Description of the context and problem]

## Decision

[The decision that was made]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Benefits]

### Negative
- [Trade-offs]
```

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial draft for discussion
2. **Accepted**: Approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: No longer recommended
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR
